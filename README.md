# SimplePackets
SimplePackets provides, as its name suggests, a library that allows other plugins to read and modify
the communication between a Minecraft server and its clients. Its main focus is on not breaking anything
and providing compatability with other plugins that reach deep into the Minecraft server and/or exploit
undefined behaviour. While it should work on any server version that's using Netty, it's primarily intended
for mini game or pvp servers on 1.8.x. That means that I will try to make this compatible with every
anticheat and every cloud system I can get access to.

# Downloads
The plugin can be downloaded on the releases page here.

# Documentation
